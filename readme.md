`tkform` provides a simple interface to tkinter to provide an HTML-inspired form-like GUI to run Python scripts.

It's cobbled together from a couple of useful widgets in the tkinter ecosystem

- a growable page with vertical scrollbar
- a custom reorderable file-list
- ouptut area for progress reports
- simple loading of form parameters
- clean hooks to the parameters to run your scripts
- no dependencies
